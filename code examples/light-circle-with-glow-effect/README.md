# Light circle with glow effect

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rgembalik/pen/OJygXJR](https://codepen.io/rgembalik/pen/OJygXJR).

I saw this effect not long time ago in a game called Griftlands. It somewhat reminds me Alexa circle, but it's not directional, nor it carries any information behind lighter and darker parts.

So I grabbed a perlin noise from http://kitfox.com/projects/perlinNoiseMaker/, played a bit with offsets, blurs and mix-blend-mode (my latest favourite toy) and here it is.

While it looks kinda cool, it needs a black background, so it's not that practical outside of nice eye-catch on some dark-mode pages;

Edit:
I must admit, this pen got much more love from the community than I would've hoped for what it is! Just wanted to add one last thing, so the latest update animates colours over and over on hover. You can add your own combinations, I just threw a couple of them. Hope you all like it!
